Selenium home assignment, notes:
1. Please look at the config.properties file to make sure all paths work
2. This project was built with java 9
3. The solution to the first problem uses saucelabs for multipile platform support, and I have left my credentials there as I am using a throwaway account, the access token will be updated a month from now thus requiring a different saucelabs account to run
4. The solution to the first problem is located under /src/tests/java
5. The solution to the second problem is located under /src/main/picker
6. This maven project uses intelliJ to run and it does so from the IDE currently.
